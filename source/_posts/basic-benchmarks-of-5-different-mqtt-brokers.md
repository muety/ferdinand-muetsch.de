In the context of my Master's thesis I conducted a very basic performance comparison of several different MQTT brokers and quickly wanted to share my insights. Please note that these benchmarks are quite superficial only. I did not aim to perform an in-depth evaluation, but rather get a basic idea of their performance in general. 

## Setup
* To perform load tests in a _publish_ scenario, I used [takanorig/mqtt-bench](https://github.com/takanorig/mqtt-bench), an MQTT benchmarking tool written in Go.
* All tests were run with the options `-count 10000`, `-clients 25` and `-size 4096`, which means to simulate 25 concurrent MQTT clients, each sending 10,000 messages of 4 KBytes size each.
* Both load testing tool as well as the respective broker were run locally on a 6-core, 12-thread, 3.6 Ghz machine with Ubuntu 18.04.
* Unless otherwise stated, the brokers were started with default configuration.

## Brokers
The following brokers were tested.

## Results
These are the results that I obtained. Higher is better.
