It has been a wild year and that applies to [Wakapi](https://wakapi.dev) as well. Now, that 2021 is almost over, I want to drop a couple of quite interesting statistics about Wakapi ü§ì.

# Coding Stats on Wakapi.dev
* A total of **4,884,871 heartbeats** were tracked this year
* They make a total of **50,746 hours (5.89 years) of coding time** in 2021
* If every heartbeat is around 225 bytes of JSON, this would be approx. **1,245 MBytes** of incoming traffic on the server
* Our user base grew by **311** to a total of **440 users**

## Top Languages
Most used programming languages are **TypeScript (26 %)**, **JavaScript (13 %)** and **PHP (10 %)**

```sql
select `key` as language, sum(total) / 60 / 60 as total
from summary_items si
         inner join summaries s
                    on summary_id = s.id and s.from_time >= '2021-01-01' and si.type = 1 and `key` != 'unknown'
group by `key`
order by total desc
limit 10;
```

## Top Editors
Most used editors / IDEs are **VS Code (49 %)**, the **Browser (10 %)** (which is not actually an editor, but there is [`chrome-wakatime`](https://github.com/wakatime/chrome-wakatime)) and **IntelliJ (idea) (9 %)**.

# Open Source Project

The Wakapi open source project itself did big steps forward, too, and the release of [version 2](https://github.com/muety/wakapi/milestone/1) is just around the corner üöÄ.

Some statistics: 
* **351 commits** were added
* **155 issues** on GitHub have been resolved
* **633 stars** were given in total (all time)
* **9945 lines of code** were added, making a total of **15316**
    ```bash
    cloc --include-lang=Go,JavaScript,HTML,Python --exclude-dir=node_modules .
    ```
* Around **176,000 lines** have changed in total this year (including generated code, though)

Thanks a lot to all contributors!

# Personal Stats
My personal coding stats look a bit different. I coded mostly in Java, followed by Go and VueJS. My total coding time this year is an astonishing amount of **899 hours (~ 5.4 weeks)**, which I spent 98 % of the time on Linux. My used IDEs are distributed more or less equally among VS Code, IntelliJ, GoLand and PyCharm.

Fun fact: during that time, I drank a total of **867 cups of coffee** ‚òïÔ∏èüò±.
