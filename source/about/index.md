# About

Hey and welcome ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ferdi, 30 years old, based in Karlsruhe, Germany and passionate about anything related to computers, software, technology and science. I love to write efficient and well-architectured code to automate task and solve real-world problems and I'm a big fan of open-source.

I got into tech back when starting my studies on [information engineering and management](https://informationswirtschaft.org) at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://kit.edu) in 2012 and sought to improve my skills and knowledge ever since. After a couple of internships and student jobs (at [Inovex](https://inovex.de), [ArtiMinds](https://artiminds.com) and [Volkswagen Group of America](https://vwiecc.com/)) and after my graduation as a M.Sc. in 2020, I worked as a professional software- / data engineer and project lead at [Frachtwerk](https://frachtwerk.de) and climate-tech startup [Orbio](https://orbio.earth). 

On the technical side, I did full-stack web (primarily Java / Spring, Go, TypeScript), geo-spatial (GIS) data engineering (mainly Python, PostGIS, etc.), as well as sysadmin and DevOps tasks (using Docker, Terraform, Ansible & Co.). 

In Feb 2023, I went back to KIT and started my PhD on the topics of autonomous driving at the chair of Prof. ZÃ¶llner on [Applied Technical-Cognitive Systems](https://aifb.kit.edu/web/Angewandte_Technisch-Kognitive_Systeme/en), Institute of Applied Informatics and Formal Description Methods. Check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ferdinand-m%C3%BCtsch/details/skills/) for more ...

Besides, I'm passionately working on a couple of [open-source projects](https://github.com/muety) and founded [server.camp](https://server.camp) with two friends. In my time off, I enjoy [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/76078245), biking and snowboarding (when there is snow in Germany...) and I love to cook!

But first and foremost, I continuously seek to improve, acquire new skills and get into new topics, because I think people should **never stop learning!**

## Project Wishlist
As someone who loves coding, I have an almost endless list of small and bigger projects that I'd like to work on some day. Of course, I will never get to actually finishing that list (especially as it grows faster than I can tick things off). But the following are some high level project ideas, problems or fields I'd love to be working on at some point.

* **Large scale energy monitoring- / management:** As mentioned before, I'm quite excited about energy informatics and had a lot of fun [building](/energy-monitoring-pt-1-ir-readers-sml-mqtt-node-red-prometheus-grafana.html) my own electricity monitoring setup. I'd love to take this onto another level and work on a project in the context of industrial IoT, smart grids or the like - with thousands of metering devices connected, complex decision- and management logic involved, sophisticated data processing, etc.
* **Application of GNNs to power grids:** During my research, I got quite deeply involved with graph neural networks and realized that they're still a comparatively underexplored topic in ML, yet with very promising applications in any kind of system that can naturally be modeled as a network of nodes and edges. Primarily inspired by [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02827), I learned about the potentials of GNNs for optimal power flow (OPF)- or cascading failure prediction in electrity grids and would love to take them for a spin for such!
* **Real-world GIS use cases:** Another field that got me hooked  is geoinformatics. I got to dive into GIS topics during my time at Orbio and even though I quit my job with them in favor of my PhD, I'd love to get another chance to be working on geodata processing projects on a large scale some time. There is incredibly great software tooling out there and I'd love to take it for a spin.
* **Game servers and low-latency networking:** This is even a totally different topic, but nevertheless super appealing to me. I'd love to have a real-world use case to implement a game server / backend at some point. I love reading blog posts where engineers come up with very specific, low-level optimizations to compute- or networking code (e.g. [here](https://technology.riotgames.com/news/fixing-internet-real-time-applications-part-i) and [here](https://technology.riotgames.com/news/peeking-valorants-netcode) at Riot, [here](https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/-broccoli--syncing-faster-by-syncing-less) at Dropbox or [here](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/09/29/why-we-spent-the-last-month-eliminating-postgresql-subtransactions/) and [here](https://neon.tech/blog/quicker-serverless-postgres) in the context of databases). Writing a game server, in my fantasy, requires a lot of such optimizations that squeeze out efficiency, so it seems very interesting to me.
* **Lanelet to OpenDRIVE conversion:** This is very specific and I'm not even sure if it's a problem possible to be solved. However, while working in autonomous driving, I realized the very specific, yet almost ubiquitous need for beeing able to convert HD maps from the simple Lanelet format to the much richer and more expressive OpenDRIVE standard. Vice-vesa [is easy](/how-to-convert-opendrive-to-lanelet2.html), but even though a lot of people have tried, to my knowledge, nobody yet managed to solve this "conversion" problem. There are good reasons for that. But still: if somebody paid me for it, I'd love to give it a try - or at least deep-dive into it to be sure that it's impossible (with reasonable effort).

## Skills
In the following, I have put together a (non-comprehensive) list of technologies that I am experienced with (some more and some less), each with a rating between 1 and 5, defined as follows:

* **1** = Basic experience. Have worked with it less than 5 years ago for more than ~ 1 week. Remember fundamentals, but couldn't start a project without substantial research for getting up to speed again.
* **2** = Substantiated experience. Have realized a (small) project with it less than 5 years ago. Can read and understand code and am confident to realize simple features using it.
* **3** = Profound experience. Work with it almost on a day to day basis. Could realize a project from scratch with confidence. Can well explain even non-trivial aspects.
* **4** = Expert-like experience. Have worked with it intesively for more than 5 years on a continuous basis. Know what's "under the hood" for the most parts.
* **5** = Could have written a book on it (or did so).
