# About

Hey and welcome ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ferdi, 30 years old, based in Karlsruhe, Germany and passionate about anything related to computers, software, technology and science. I love to write efficient and well-architectured code to automate task and solve real-world problems and I'm a big fan of open-source.

I got into tech back when starting my studies on [information engineering and management](https://informationswirtschaft.org) at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://kit.edu) in 2012 and sought to improve my skills and knowledge ever since. After a couple of internships and student jobs (at [Inovex](https://inovex.de), [ArtiMinds](https://artiminds.com) and [Volkswagen Group of America](https://vwiecc.com/)) and after my graduation as a M.Sc. in 2020, I worked as a professional software- / data engineer and project lead at [Frachtwerk](https://frachtwerk.de) and [Orbio](https://orbio.earth). 

On the technical side, I did full-stack web (primarily Java / Spring, TypeScript), geo-spatial (GIS) data engineering (mainly Python, PostGIS, etc.), as well as sysadmin and DevOps tasks (using TerraForm, Ansible & Co.). 

In Feb 2023, I went back to KIT and started my PhD on the topics of autonomous driving at the chair of Prof. ZÃ¶llner on [Applied Technical-Cognitive Systems](https://aifb.kit.edu/web/Angewandte_Technisch-Kognitive_Systeme/en), Institute of Applied Informatics and Formal Description Methods. Check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ferdinand-m%C3%BCtsch/details/skills/) for more ...

Besides, I'm passionately working on a couple of [open-source projects](https://github.com/muety) and founded [server.camp](https://server.camp) with two friends.

I continuously seek to improve, acquire new skills and get into new topics, because I think people should **never stop learning!**

## Project Wishlist
As someone who loves coding, I have an almost endless list of small and bigger projects that I'd like to work on some day. Of course, I will never get to actually finishing that list (especially as it grows faster than I can tick things off). But the following are some high level project ideas, problems or fields I'd love to be working on at some point.

* **Large scale energy monitoring- / management:** As mentioned before, I'm quite excited about energy informatics and had a lot of fun [building](/energy-monitoring-pt-1-ir-readers-sml-mqtt-node-red-prometheus-grafana.html) my own electricity monitoring setup. I'd love to take this onto another level and work on a project in the context of industrial IoT, smart grids or the like - with thousands of metering devices connected, complex decision- and management logic involved, sophisticated data processing, etc.
* **Real-world GIS use cases:** Another field that got me hooked  is geoinformatics. I got to dive into GIS topics during my time at Orbio and even though I quit my job with them in favor of my PhD, I'd love to get another chance to be working on geodata processing projects on a large scale some time. There is incredibly great software tooling out there and I'd love to take it for a spin.
* **Game servers and low-latency networking:** This is even a totally different topic, but nevertheless super appealing to me. I'd love to have a real-world use case to implement a game server / backend at some point. I love reading blog posts where engineers come up with very specific, low-level optimizations to compute- or networking code (e.g. [here](https://technology.riotgames.com/news/fixing-internet-real-time-applications-part-i) and [here](https://technology.riotgames.com/news/peeking-valorants-netcode) at Riot, [here](https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/-broccoli--syncing-faster-by-syncing-less) at Dropbox or [here](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/09/29/why-we-spent-the-last-month-eliminating-postgresql-subtransactions/) and [here](https://neon.tech/blog/quicker-serverless-postgres) in the context of databases). Writing a game server, in my fantasy, requires a lot of such optimizations that squeeze out efficiency, so it seems very interesting to me.
* **Lanelet to OpenDRIVE conversion:** This is very specific and I'm not even sure if it's a problem possible to be solved. However, while working in autonomous driving, I realized the very specific, yet almost ubiquitous need for beeing able to convert HD maps from the simple Lanelet format to the much richer and more expressive OpenDRIVE standard. Vice-very [is easy](/how-to-convert-opendrive-to-lanelet2.html), but even though a lot of prople have tried, to my knowledge, nobody yet came up with solving this "conversion" problems. There are good reasons for that. But still: if somebody paid me for it, I'd love to give it a try - or at least deep-dive into it to be sure that it's impossible (with reasonable effort).
