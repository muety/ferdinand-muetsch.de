# About

Hey and welcome ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ferdi, 30 years old, based in Karlsruhe, Germany and passionate about anything related to computers, software, technology and science. I love to write efficient and well-architectured code to automate task and solve real-world problems and I'm a big fan of open-source.

I got into tech back when starting my studies on [information engineering and management](https://informationswirtschaft.org) at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://kit.edu) in 2012 and sought to improve my skills and knowledge ever since. After a couple of internships and student jobs (at [Inovex](https://inovex.de), [ArtiMinds](https://artiminds.com) and [Volkswagen Group of America](https://vwiecc.com/)) and after my graduation as a M.Sc. in 2020, I worked as a professional software- / data engineer and project lead at [Frachtwerk](https://frachtwerk.de) and [Orbio](https://orbio.earth). 

On the technical side, I did full-stack web (primarily Java / Spring, TypeScript), geo-spatial (GIS) data engineering (mainly Python, PostGIS, etc.), as well as sysadmin and DevOps tasks (using TerraForm, Ansible & Co.). 

In Feb 2023, I went back to KIT and started my PhD on the topics of autonomous driving at the chair of Prof. ZÃ¶llner on [Applied Technical-Cognitive Systems](https://aifb.kit.edu/web/Angewandte_Technisch-Kognitive_Systeme/en), Institute of Applied Informatics and Formal Description Methods. Check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ferdinand-m%C3%BCtsch/details/skills/) for more ...

Besides, I'm passionately working on a couple of [open-source projects](https://github.com/muety) and founded [server.camp](https://server.camp) with two friends.

I continusouly seek to improve, acquire new skills and get into new topics, because I think people should **never stop learning!**
