# About

Hey and welcome ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ferdinand, 28 years old, based in Karlsruhe, Germany and am passionate about anything related to software and information technology. I love to write efficient and optimized code to automate task and solve real-world problems and I'm a big fan of open-source.

I got into tech back when starting my studies on [information engineering and management](https://informationswirtschaft.org) at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://kit.edu) in 2012 and sought to improve my skills and knowledge ever since. I used to work in full-stack web dev as a student employee and intern at various companies, including [Inovex](https://inovex.de), [ArtiMinds](https://artiminds.com) and the Volkswagen Group of America Electronic Research Lab [(ERL)](https://vwiecc.com/). All of them were a great experience for me and helped me grow a lot. Over time, I went from basic web development into full-stack dev, DevOps, data engineering and software architecture.

In 2020, I finished my Master's with a thesis on the subjects of _Cooperative Perception and Cellular Vehicle-2-X Communication for Autonomous Driving_ at [ITIV](https://itiv.kit.edu). After that, I first worked at [Frachtwerk](https://frachtwerk.de) as a software engineer and project lead, and later at an upcoming ClimateTech startup, [Orbio Earth](https://orbio.earth), as a software architect, data engineer and dev team lead.

Just recently, in Feb 2023, I started my PhD on the topics of autonomous driving at the chair of Prof. ZÃ¶llner on [Applied Technical-Cognitive Systems](https://aifb.kit.edu/web/Angewandte_Technisch-Kognitive_Systeme/en), Institute of Applied Informatics and Formal Description Methods.

I continusouly seek to improve, acquire new skills and get into new topics. I think people should **never stop learning!**

## My topics
Full-Stack Web, Software Architecture, Data Engineering, Systems Administration, Cloud Automation

## My Languages
Go (â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…), Java (â˜…â˜…â˜…), Python (â˜…â˜…â˜…), JavaScript / TypeScript (â˜…â˜…â˜…)
